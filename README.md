# Local Library Qualified assessment

This repository contains a completed assessment of the "Project Local Library". The project helps you learn how to create local Library page using JavaScript, while also getting familiar with basic design principles.

## Project Overview

- I developed a Local Library web using JavaScript to manage books, authors, and borrowing records.
- This project focused on building an interactive discovery platform that allows users to search, update, and see checked out books.
- I implemented array methods to manage the library data efficiently.
- Testing and debugging were ongoing steps, making sure that features like search, filtering, and checked out books worked correctly.
- The final result is a functional, user-friendly library management system that demonstrates strong understanding of core JavaScript concepts.

## Features

- Borrow and return system
- Display available vs borrowed books
- Search books by title or author

# Customization

- Initialize empty array to store book data.
- Implement add/remove/search functions.
- Refactor and optimize code for readability and efficiency.
- Algorithms used; .filter() for search functionality, .map() for rendering transformation, .find() to locate books by ID.
